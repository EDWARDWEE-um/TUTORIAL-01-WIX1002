# WIX1002 FUNDAMENTALS OF PROGRAMMING TUTORIAL 1 PROBLEM SOLVING IN PROGRAMMING
Build the pseudocode and flow chart for each of the problems:
## PART 1
1. Request two numbers from the user and print the multiplication of the numbers.
```Pseudocode
Start
Request first number,n1
Request second number,n2
Answer = n1*n2
Print Answer
End
```
2. Determine whether a random number is greater than 50.
```Pseudocode
Generate a random number
If number is greater than 50
  Print " Greater than 50"
else
  Print " Lesser than 50 or equal to 50"
End
```
3. Print the pass/fail grade based on the mark entered by user. The passing mark is at least 40.
```
Start
Prompt user to input mark, M
If mark is greater or equal 40
  Print " Pass "
Otherwise
  Print " Fail "
End
```
4. Print the results of the two players' dice game
```
Start
Generate first random number, P1 from (1-6)
Generate second random numner, P2 from(1-6)
If P1 = P2 
  Print " tie "
Otherwise
  If P1>P2
  Print" Player 1 wins"
Otherwise
  Print" Player 2 wins"
End
```
5. Print the perimeter of a rectangle.
```
Start
Request width of rectangle, X
Request length of rectangle, Y
Perimeter of rectangle = X + X + Y + Y
Print Perimter of rectangle
End
```
6. Print the minimum number from 10 random numbers generated by computer.
```
Start
Generate a random number
Assign the random number as the minimum number
Start the counter as 1
while counter is lesser than 10
  Generate a random number
If the random number is less than the minimum number
  Assign the random number as the minimum number
Else 
  Do nothing
Increase counter by 1
Print the minimum number
End
```
7. Print the number of odd and even number from 10 random numbers generated by computer. The random number must be from 10-100.
```
Start
even number = evenNumber
odd number = oddNumber
Assign evenNumber as 0 and oddNumber as 0
Assign counter as 1
While counter is less than 10
  Generate a random number from 10-100
  if the random number modulus 2 equal to 0
    increase the evenNumber by 1
  else
    increase the oddNumber by 1
Print even number and odd number 
End
```
## Part 2
8. Count the number of alphabet U and M from a sentence entered by user.
```
Start
U = characterU
M = characterM
Assign characterU as 0 and characterM as 0
Assign an index that point to the first character of the sentence 
While the index is less than the length of the sentence
  read the character according to the index 
  if the character is U
    increase the characterU by 1
  or if the character is M
    increase the characterM by 1
  increase the index by1 
Print the number of character U and M
End
```
9. Display the frequency of a keyword from a web page.
```
Start
Initialise the frequency of keyword as 0
Obtain a keyword from the user
Read from a web page
while the web page is not end of the file
  read one line from page
  for each word in the line
  if the word is equal to keyword
  increase the frequency of keyword by 1
Print frequency of the keyword  
End
```
10. Display the number of female student from a random list of 100 students
```
Start
Initialise a counter as 1
While the counter is less than or equal to 100
  Randomly generate a student with a gender (Male/Female)
  Store the student in the list
  Increase the counter by 1
Female student = femaleStudent
Assign femaleStudent as 0
for each student in the list
 if the gender is female
   increase the femaleStudent by 1
Print the number of female student
End
```
