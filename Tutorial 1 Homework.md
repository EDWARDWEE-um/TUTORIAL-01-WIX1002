# WIX1002 FUNDAMENTALS OF PROGRAMMING TUTORIAL 1 PROBLEM SOLVING IN PROGRAMMING
Build the pseudocode and flow chart for each of the problems:
## PART 1
1. Request two numbers from the user and print the multiplication of the numbers.
```Pseudocode
Start
Request first number,n1
Request second number,n2
Answer = n1*n2
Print Answer
End
```
2. Determine whether a random number is greater than 50.
```Pseudocode
Generate a random number
If number is greater than 50
  Print " Greater than 50"
else
  Print " Lesser than 50 or equal to 50"
End
```
3. Print the pass/fail grade based on the mark entered by user. The passing mark is at least 40.
```
Start
Prompt user to input mark, M
If mark is greater or equal 40
  Print " Pass "
Otherwise
  Print " Fail "
End
```
4. Print the results of the two players' dice game
```
Start
Generate first random number, P1 from (1-6)
Generate second random numner, P2 from(1-6)
If P1 = P2 
  Print " tie "
Otherwise
  If P1>P2
  Print" Player 1 wins"
Otherwise
  Print" Player 2 wins"
End
```
5. Print the perimeter of a rectangle.
```
Start
Request width of rectangle, X
Request length of rectangle, Y
Perimeter of rectangle = X + X + Y + Y
Print Perimter of rectangle
End
```
6. Print the minimum number from 10 random numbers generated by computer.
```
Start
Generate a random number
Assign the random number as the minimum number
Start the counter as 1
while counter is lesser than 10
  Generate a random number
If the random number is less than the minimum number
  Assign the random number as the minimum number
Else 
  Do nothing
Increase counter by 1
Print the minimum number
End
```
